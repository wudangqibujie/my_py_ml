# Machine Learning Algorithms, Implemented in TensorFlow
This is a repository of ML algorithms I have implemented in TensorFlow. The goal of this project was 

1. To implement these algorithms from a low level, in order to better understand them
2. To learn TensorFlow at a deeper level than basic tutorials would allow

I  would highly recommend this task to anybody seeking to accomplish either objective. 

The algorithms implemented are:

* OLS (Ordinary Least Squares Regression)
* Logit (Logistic Regression)
* KMeans (K-Means Clustering)
* KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
* PageRank (Google's algorithm for ranking search results)
* MLP (Multilayer Perceptrion - a Basic Feed-Forward Neural Network)
* Autoencoder
* RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)

My hope is to continue adding algorithms and improving these implementations with time.
