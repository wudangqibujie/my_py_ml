Initialization:
X: [n x 2], randomly drawn from normal distribution
centroids: [k x 2], also randomly drawn

Reshaping stage:
X: [n x 2] => [n x k x 2] * same as the n x 2 representation, but repeat each observation k times in the k x 2 sub-matrices
centroids: [k x 2] => [n x k x 2]  * each kx2 is the centroid coordinates. repeat these n times.

Calculate distances from observations to centroids:
* reduce_sum of squared distances between reshaped X and reshaped centroids. [n x k x 2] reduced to [n x k] distance matrix
* assignments = Arg_min(distances) => [n x 1], where each observation is the ID of the centroid with lowest distance 

Update centroids:
coords = (mean(x and y coords) where cluster == k) for each k. Uses tf.unsorted_segment_sum for this.
